# Basketball-Simulation

This project is a basketball simulation program written in Java. The user can upload team information via a formatted text file. Two made up teams can then play each other in a game. Currently, this process is done though the console. Below is a list of future features:
* Have individual player stats with player substitutions
* Simulate entire seasons
* Create a GUI for the application
